# Frontend Mentor – Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/juliengDev), a platform focused on improving front-end development skills through real-world projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice responsive and accessible front-end development.
- Apply modern tools and workflows such as **Tailwind CSS**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.
- Improve layout precision based on Figma designs.
- Strengthen code structure, component reusability, and styling consistency.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Depending on the challenge, I use a combination of:

- HTML5 (semantic markup)
- CSS3 / Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Vite (for development/build)
- Git for version control
- GitHub/GitLab Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for deployment

## 📁 Structure

Each folder in this repository represents an individual challenge:

```
├── 01_equalizer-landing-page
├── 02_3-column_preview_card_component
├── …
└── README.md
```

Each challenge includes its own source code, a local `README.md` (with description and solution), and build output if applicable.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a front-end developer transitioning from 11 years in the IT industry (technical support & networking). I’m now focused on modern web development, primarily with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Next.js**, while expanding toward full-stack capabilities.

## 🚀 Deployment

Each challenge is tested locally using Vite and optionally deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## 🔒 Repository Privacy

- This repository is used for learning and practice purposes.
- Only a few carefully selected projects are made public on my GitHub profile to keep it focused for professional use.
- Some challenges are hosted privately to avoid clutter and maintain a clean portfolio.

Let me know if you’d like to add badges, links to live previews, or break this up into multiple READMEs per challenge.
