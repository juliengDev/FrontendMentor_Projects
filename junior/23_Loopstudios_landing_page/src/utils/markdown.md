_ITALIC_  
To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, \_this_ word would become italic.

**BOLD**  
To make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really\*\* get your point across.

## Header

To make headers in Markdown, you preface the phrase with a hash mark (#). You place the same number of hash marks as the size of the header you want. For example, for a header one, you'd use one hash mark (# Header One), while for a header three, you'd use three (### Header Three).

## Links

There are two different link types in Markdown, but both of them render the exact same way. The first link style is called an inline link. To create an inline link, you wrap the link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then you wrap the link in parentheses ( ( ) ). For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](www.github.com).

The other link type is called a reference link. As the name implies, the link is actually a reference to another place in the document. Here's an example of what we mean:

Here's [a link to something else][another place].
Here's [yet another link][another-link].
And now back to [the first link][another place].

[another place]: www.github.com
[another-link]: www.google.com
